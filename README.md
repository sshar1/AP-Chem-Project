# The Legend of Sodium
A simple game made with Pygame for my AP Chem final project

## Objective
You are a happy neutral sodium atom until fluorine steals all your electrons. Gather your electrons and get revenge!

## Electrons

There are 6 of these moving throughout the map. If you catch one and answer its chemistry question, it will be added to your valence shell. You can hold a max of 14.

## Heat

There are 2 of these moving throughout the map. They're super small and fast. If you collect enough, you can eject extra electrons. You can hold a max of 3.

## Fluorine

This is the atom that stole your electrons! It's super big but moves very slowly. If you run into it when you're not neutral, you'll lose some electrons. If you are neutral, you must answer its 5 questions to win. If you get a question wrong, game over!
